          <div class="para" style="font-size: 16px;">
            <p>I'm from Orlando, FL, and I'm a student at <a href="https://duke.edu/" target="_blank">Duke University</a> studying Computer Science and Statistics. Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.ivella.co/" target="_blank">Ivella</a>, an early-stage fintech startup.
              I'm really interested in driving impactful change through data and tech in the financial services and healthcare industries.
            </p>
            <p>
              From my prior experiences at various biotech startups, I found a passion for entrepreneurship and impact, while also having grown my own technical software engineering skills.  
              Last summer, I followed this passion while interning at <a href="https://www.optum.com/" target="_blank">UnitedHealth Group</a> where I constructed a nationwide drug shortage platform for data visualization and recommendations. For more, check out my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PBGF2193CI2iMHnrcwfl9xcXELR9FUo4/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">resume</a>!</p>
            <p>On campus, I'm part of the Executive team of the <a href="https://www.dukeaml.com/" target="_blank">Duke Applied Machine Learning Group</a>, where I help coordinate events and meetings for over 100 students, and am a Consulting Analyst at the <a href="https://www.dukeimpact.org/" target="_blank">Duke Impact Investing Group</a>, where I research impact metrics for a disaster-preparedness <a href="https://needslist.co/" target="_blank">NGO</a> and an impact-focused <a href="https://newstory.co/" target="_blank">Venture Fund</a>.
              I'm also a part of other entrepreneurship and business-related groups as well such as the Student Founders program.</p>
            <p>Fun fact about me: a friend and I once 'cracked' the Subway receipt cookie code algorithm in middle school and got a thousand free cookies üç™.
              Some of my interests include sustainability, politics, martial arts, and gluten-free cooking. I'm also a fan of the Orlando Magic and Duke Basketball! </p>

          <h2 class="underline--magical">üì∏ My Life</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 16px;">My life and personal values are a product of my upbringing in an Indian household and certain role models who I've looked up to throughout.
            My personal role models are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey" target="_blank">Jack Dorsey</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Neistat" target="_blank">Casey Neistat</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella" target="_blank">Satya Nadella</a>.
            Together, they're some of the most creative minds and embrace my values as well!</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px;">In my free time, I love watching new TV shows (Billions is great right now), learning new gluten-free recipes, and playing strategy games like Catan. I'm also a huge fan of mexican and italian cuisine</p>
          <h5>Personal Values</h5>
          <ul style="font-size: 17px;">
            <li><strong>Ambition:</strong> I always try to know what I'm striving towards, even though it can be tough at times.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> constant and open communication are crucial to success and I always aim to carry them in any team I join.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> As someone who currently struggles accessibility issues, having equitable opportunities for all is very important to me, whether it's regarding product features or team contribution.</li>

                <p>
                  I'm a huge fan of music and I can't code without it. I usually listen to around 5 hours every single day across all genres. My three favorite artists are Eminem, The Weeknd, and Drake but recently I've begun listening to more Anderson .Paak and Fleetwood Mac.</p>
                <p>
                  My appreciation for music began from a young age when I learned classical piano, and it continued as I picked up the clarinet and saxophone. 
                  Since, it's shaped how I approach the world from a creative standpoint and I've seen my tastes accordingly shift over time.

            <div class="gallery-text para" style="padding-left: 20px;">
              <p>I led a team of 4 to create an automated system detect and report environmental hazards. The need for this app came as we observed litter, fallen trees, and cracked sidewalks in the streets of Arlington, VA. I built an iOS front-end app in Swift with a back-end RESTful API in Flask, and an administrator dashboard in React JS. One notable feature I implemented was web automation with convolutional neural networks on Google Cloud platform, allowing for the images taken to be processed and correctly sorted by hazard type.</p>
              <p>This project was build for HoyaHacks 2020 at Georgetown University and ended up winning 2nd place. Following the competition, I began talks with Arlington City officials to implement this app within their Parks and Recreation department.</p>

              <p>As part of my Fall 2019 class "Machine Learning and Computational Modeling," I created a predictor model for fantasy points of NFL players in the past 20 years based on college season and NFL Combine statistics.
                To do this, I applied regularization and bootstrap regression in Scikit-learn using BeautifulSoup and Selenium for automated data scraping. I evaluated model efficacy using Mean Squared Error and also implemented PCA (Principal Component Analysis) in the process to select from over 100 input variables.

              <p>At the University of Florida during Summer 2018, I worked in the Computer Information, Science and Engineering Department under Dr. J√∂rg Peters to create a surgical simulation using programming in Python and Java. 
                This research has far-reaching implications for surgeons and specialists who can use the platform to practice and create specialized scenarios as it can help train future generations of surgeons through virtual reality scenarios. 
                In the last few months, my work has since been introduced into the UF database. 
                Further, I presented my paper, ‚ÄúDeveloping a Surgical Simulation for a Laparoscopic Hepatectomy,‚Äù in front of a team of researchers and professors at the conclusion of my research project.

              <p>Although I began as a research assistant, this research project transformed into a startup for nutrition recommendation, Nutrics.
                Within this health recommendation app, I worked to integrate with Apple Health data and Geolocation APIs, as well as engineer middleware to work with the server-side recommendation learning algorithms in TensorFlow.
              </p>
              <p>I also helped gather data and eventually attract $75,000 in grants from the National Institutes of Health to continue the work.</p>
              <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Swift, Flutter, Python (Selenium, BeautifulSoup, TensorFlow)</p>
